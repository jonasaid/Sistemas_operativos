**Add any notes here about your design decisions or improvements you would have made if you had more time. You may also want to consider the following questions for inspiration.**

  * Using a Lambda to Inject the Parser into the EasyBrokerSynchronizer Class: The decision to use a lambda for creating the parser allows for flexibility in the parser configuration, making it easier to test and use different implementations if needed.

  * The strategy to unpublish properties that are not in the XML file is quite straightforward. It involves comparing the IDs in the database with those in the file to determine which properties need to be changed. Additionally, this implementation only makes one database call, making it more efficient to update the published column for all necessary properties instead of making multiple calls for each property.

  * These unit tests are more like integration tests since they depend on the test database. I would have liked to write tests that didnâ€™t rely so much on the database, but instead used a mock for the database itself. However, I understand that this can be challenging when working with Active Record due to its strong integration with the database. Despite this, the current tests allow us to verify that the entire synchronization flow works correctly in an environment as close to production as possible, which is beneficial for ensuring the validity of the system's behavior.

  * Two packages were added: one is rdoc to generate HTML documentation for the EasyBrokerSynchronizer class. The other package, called mocha, is used to create mocks for the parser.

**Are there any performance issues with your code or things you can easily speed up?**

Yes, there are several areas where performance could be improved. One of the main areas is how properties are synchronized with the database. It could be more efficient if batch processing were implemented. By grouping properties into batches and performing insertions and updates in bulk, the number of database operations, which typically have higher associated costs, can be reduced. However, batch processing increases memory usage, as multiple properties need to be kept in memory simultaneously. While it is possible to handle 1000 properties in memory on a server with 1GB of RAM, the memory cost increases and must be managed to avoid exceeding the server's capacity.

**Can you successfully load a file with 100 million properties on a server with less than 1 GB? Briefly explain why you can or can't charge it.**

Yes, because the EasySax library efficiently processes XML records by only loading those that are being iterated over. At any point in the program, only one property is loaded in memory. Memory usage could be further reduced if the ignore attribute of the parse_each method is used.

**Are there areas of your code that you think are not so "clean"?**

Yes, there are some areas that could be improved to make the code cleaner and more efficient:

  * The parser could be passed already instantiated to the EasyBrokerSynchronizer class instead of receiving a lambda that instantiates it. This would make the code more readable but would require introducing additional logic to instantiate the parser, possibly in another class. This approach could improve the separation of responsibilities and facilitate testing and reuse of the parser in different contexts.

  * The code does not include explicit error or exception handling in critical operations, such as reading the file or updating the database. Implementing error handling would make the code more robust and reliable.

**If you couldn't finish, what were you able to complete? Were you satisfied with your progress given the time constraints?**

According to the requirements, I managed to cover all the essential points and implemented an adequate amount of unit tests. Although it would be beneficial to conduct more tests and optimizations to handle large volumes of data and ensure optimal performance, I am satisfied with the progress achieved so far.
